## How to open up the project on Unity Editor
This game was developed using **Unity Editor 2020.3.32f1**, we suggest you to download this version because different ones (especially older) might give problems.

Once you've downloaded the repository and extracted it into a folder, open up the folder SOLR using the Unity Hub. If the version of the Unity Editor you're using to open the project is the correct one, no error should appear.

## Quick presentation slides
The following presentation is a summary of the main features. For a detailed explanations of the realisation of all aspects of the game, please read the file **report.pdf**.

## Aesthetics and immersion design

This is a simple vr experience coded to learn the innerworkings of the unity gui and engine. All the movements and interactions are coded from scratch. This expereince has a checker coded that looks to see if a VR headset is plugged in. If a headset is plugged in, the experience will run in VR, should the user not have a headset the program then swithes to a computer based input sytesm (mouse and keyboard). The switcher program, user movement and interactions and enviornmeent interaction were all coded from scratch. The c# files are viewable in the root directory and asset folders.

The object of the game is to turn the solar panels to face the sun. Utilizing the raycasting engine, this was pretty straightforward and didn't require much math (so much nice than older 3d engines, or coding from scratch!).

Once the panels face the sun, the game is won! A jumotron like textmesh displays the results.


## ðŸ›  Skills

C#, Unity Engine, Oculus Framework, XR Interaction Toolkit. Game design and development of the game mechanics from scratch using only the Unity engine and the basic XR Framework for Virtual Reality interactions (the popular VRTK was not allowed, as it had most of the common vr-mechanics already coded), free Unity Store's assets but only of single objects, not whole scenes.
