## How to open up the project on Unity Editor
This game was developed using **Unity Editor 2020.3.32f1**, we suggest you to download this version because different ones (especially older) might give problems.


Once you've downloaded the repository and extracted it into a folder, open up the folder SOLR using the Unity Hub. If the version of the Unity Editor you're using to open the project is the correct one, no error should appear.

## Quick presentation slides
The following presentation is a summary of the main features. For a detailed explanations of the realisation of all aspects of the game, please read the file **report.pdf**.
